Turtl.co coding assignment
====================================

# Introduction
Provide your solution to this coding assignment:

Let's say you have an empty web page open in your web browser. The width and height of your web browser window can vary.
Calculate the biggest square you can fit on the page (position, edge length). Then calculate the next biggest square you can fit
without overlapping any other squares that are already on the page. Keep doing this until there is no room left on the page
and you have calculated all the squares you can fit on it.

Write at least a few tests that verify your code works.

You don't have to actually draw the squares or even run your code inside a web browser. You can do the assignment in any programming
language. In fact, we suggest you use the one you are most comfortable with.
